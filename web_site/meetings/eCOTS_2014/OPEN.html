				<b>Overview:</b> The OPEN initiative (Online Probability Education Network) aims to
				build a	network of sites and a community of instructors focused on (1)
			experimentally testing the effectiveness of interactive learning
			materials developed by the Distributome and other opne-STEM science projects
			to advance student understanding of probability concepts; (2) sustaining and
			replenishing a substantial library of these interactive resources
			(especially game-based resources); (3) identifying and finding
			solutions to pedagogical challenges in teaching probability through
			faculty communities providing support for instructors using
			Distributome materials in their teaching; (4) integrating an
			effective dissemination and professional development infrastructure
			to ensure on-going and expanded use and community support.; and (5)
			developing advanced computational libraries, user-friendly and
			device-agnostic interfaces to support teaching and learning of
			probability modeling and distributional thinking. </br> </br>
			
			<b>Infrastructure:</b> OPEN will share knowledge, materials and resources, organize 
			conferences, workshops, webinars, and provide support for faculty communities. The network 
			will forge technological advances, and build sustainable digital libraries
			with proven value-added educational resources. There are several
			novel features of this project. OPEN will build the
			infrastructure for community-based development, expansion and
			validation of the probability models’ meta-data, computational
			libraries, and learning activities. The resources will be stored,
			processed, searched, traversed and updated in the Cloud by experts
			and educators who can identify challenges, exchange ideas, and learn
			from each other as they implement OPEN resources in their courses.
			Specifically, based on community input, we will extend our open
			(development and utilization), device-agnostic, extensible and broad
			framework for learning, teaching, navigation, discovery and usage of
			probability distributions in diverse educational settings and
			scientific applications. </br> </br>
			
			<b>Users:</b> The user-base of the OPEN infrastructure
			will include both educators (integrating the graphical tools and
			instructional materials in their course curricula and participating
			in a unique virtual community led by a cadre of activists involved in
			experimental testing of the effectiveness of the materials) and most
			importantly learners (exploring, validating and understanding the use
			of probability distributions and models for practical problem
			solving). The OPEN initiative will enable representation,
			demonstration, computation and visualization of data, models and
			applications. A large number of probability models, distribution
			interrelations, and diverse applications will be integrated with
			associated in-class and out-of-class activities and games to advance
			learning. Our broad-based dissemination plan includes communication
			with mathematical science departments teaching upper division
			probability, conference presentations, regular webinars, journal and
			newsletter publications, and connections to national professional and
			digital library organizations. Monthly virtual meetings of the OPEN
			community, annual instructor training events, and continuous
			networking workshops will engage the community in this effort and
			recruit advocates to sustain efforts at creating, editing and
			reviewing these resources. The evaluation of the project draws on the
			efforts of an independent evaluator as well as the experiences of the
			OPEN community but most importantly on the randomized controlled
			experimental testing of the effectiveness of the developed resources
			for learning key concepts in probability modeling at diverse
			institutions. </br> </br>
