The [Distributome Project (http://distributome.org)](http://distributome.org/) is an open-source, open content-development project for exploring, discovering, learning and computational utilization of diverse probability distributions. Probability distributions are a special class of functions defined in terms of integrals of positive density functions. Distribution functions are very useful in representation, modeling and interpretation of various observable processes and natural phenomena. Probability densities are a non-negative functions that integrate to one over the real numbers. A probability density function can be seen as a smooth version of a frequency histogram.

The current Distributome [XML meta-data on distribution properties and inter-distribution relations is available here](http://www.socr.ucla.edu/distributome/jars/distributome.xml), and the [current XSD schema is available here](http://www.socr.ucla.edu/distributome/jars/distributome.xsd).

The [interactive Distributome graphical user Navigator (requires Java)](http://www.socr.ucla.edu/distributome/Navigator.html) and the [Distributome-Editor](http://www.socr.ucla.edu/distributome/DistributomeEditor.html) provide the following core functions:
  * visually traverse the space of all well-defined (named) distributions;
  * explore the relations between different distributions;
  * distribution search by keyword, property and type;
  * obtain qualitative (e.g., analytic form of density function) and quantitative (e.g., critical and probability values) information about each distribution;
  * discover  references and additional distribution resources.
  * Revise, Add and Edit the properties, interrelations and meta-data for various distributions.

The Distributome project was initiated in 2008 by the [UCLA Statistics Online Computational Resource](http://www.socr.ucla.edu/), the [UAH Virtual Laboratories in Probability and Statistics](http://www.math.uah.edu/stat/), and the [OSU Mathematical Biosciences Institute](http://mbi.osu.edu/). Since 2010, the Distributome project is funded in part by the [National Science Foundation (NSF)](http://www.nsf.gov) grants [1023115](http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=1023115), [1022560](http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=1022560), and [1022636](http://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward.do?AwardNumber=1022636).
