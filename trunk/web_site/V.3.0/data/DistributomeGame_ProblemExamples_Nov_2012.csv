X = how much toothpaste (in ounces) is in the current tube at a randomly chosen time.,Continuous Uniform,A=0; B=6.25,toothpaste used up at a constant pace,
4,Correct Change,X = how many of the next 20 customers at a hot dog stand have the correct change to pay for their purchases.,Binomial,n = 20; p = probability that a random customer has the correct change,customers are essentially independent,also approximately normal if p is not too small or too large
5,Lemon Law,"Ohio's “lemon law"" allows people who buy a “lemon"" (a vehicle that turns out to be excessively defective) to return it for a refund. However, in Ohio, only about 24 cars are expected to be declared “lemons"" each year. X = the time until the next car is returned under Ohio's lemon law.",Exponential,r = 24 per year (mean = 1/24 year or 1/2 month),time to rare event,
6,Powerball Lottery,X = the first number drawn (from the numbers 1 to 59) for this week's Powerball lottery.,discrete uniform,a=1; b=59,equal chances on numbers,
7,Survey First Responder,"A polling company gets respondents for a survey through random digit dialing.  However there is a large proportion of people, who are not available or refuse to answer the survey questions.  X=how many calls must be made before they get the first respondent.  ",Geometric,p = probability that a person is available and willing to be interviewed when called,calls until first success,
8,Survey 100 Responder,"A polling company gets respondents for a survey through random digit dialing.  However there is a large proportion of people, who are not available or refuse to answer the survey questions. The company needs a sample of 100 respondents in order to fulfill a contract. X=how many calls are made before they fulfill their contract.",Negative Binomial,k = 100; p = probability that a person is available and willing to be interviewed when called,calls until 100th success,also approximately normal if p is not too small
9,GW Bridge Traffic,"The George Washington Bridge connecting New Jersey and New York is the busiest bridge in the world, carrying about 100 million vehicles a year.  On average, there is approximately one fatal accident per 20 million vehicles.  X = the number of fatal accidents on the George Washington Bridge next year.",Poisson,lamda = 5,fatal accidents are rare and close to indpendentof each other,
10,B-negative Blood Type,X = How many people must be tested until you find 3 that have a B negative blood type.  ,Negative Binomial,k = 3; p = probabilitity that a random person has B- blood (about 2%),tests until 3rd success,
11,25 Die Rolls,X = how many of each number you get when you roll a die 25 times,Multinomial,n = 25; p1=p2=p3=p4=p5=p6 = 1/6,counting multiple categories,
12,DNA Radiation Damage,A radiation source causes the strand of DNA along a chromosome to randomly break into two pieces (i.e. one break point). X = the proportion of the way from one end of the strand to the other that the break occurs.,Standard Uniform,none (or A=0; B=1 in general uniform),probability spread evenly,
13,Miami Homicide,The homicide rate in Miami Florida averages 1 per week throughout the year. X = the day when Miami will see it’s 10th homicide next year.,Gamma,k = 10; theta = 7,time to 10th rare event,
14,Extra Large Eggs,The USDA defines an “Extra Large” egg as one weighing between 2.25 and 2.5 ounces.  Eggs are packaged by the dozen with 30 dozen to a case. X = the total weight (ounces) of the eggs in a random case delivered to a grocery.,Normal,mu ≈ 855 ounces; sigma ≈ 1.37 ounces,sum of large number of  independent comparable parts,Assume relatively uniform distribution of weights between 2.25 and 2.5 ounces per egg .  Otherwise can get bounds on mu and sigma that will be close to these values.
15,B-negative Blood Type,X = How many people must be tested until you find someone with a B negative blood type.  ,Geometric,p = probabilitity that a random person has B- blood (about 2%),tests until 1st success,
16,GW Bridge Traffic,"The George Washington Bridge connecting New Jersey and New York is the busiest bridge in the world, carrying about 100 million vehicles a year.  On average, there is approximately one fatal accident per 20 million vehicles.  X = the time (in years) until the next fatal accident on the George Washington Bridge.",Exponential,r = 5 per year (mean = 1/r = 1/5 year),time to rare event,Assumption of constant rate may not be appropriate (affects the mean - but exponential distribution still likely to be reasonable)
17,Penn Turnpike Call-boxes,Emergency call-boxes are systematically placed 1 mile apart along the Pennsylvania Turnpike where cell phone service is very spotty. Your car breaks down suddenly as you are driving east on the Pennsylvania Turnpike though luckily you had been keeping an eye out for the call boxes before your breakdown.  X= the distance you will need to walk to reach the closest call-box.,Uniform,A = 0; B = 0.5,no preference for any particular place to break down,
18,Penn Turnpike Call-boxes,Emergency call-boxes are systematically placed 1 mile apart along the Pennsylvania Turnpike where cell phone service is very spotty. Your car breaks down as you are driving east on the Pennsylvania Turnpike so you walk eastward until you reach a call-box..  X= the distance in miles you will need to walk to reach the next call-box.,Standard Uniform,none (or A=0; B=1 in general uniform),no preference for any particular place to break down,
19,B-negative Blood Type,X = How many people have a B negative blood type in a sample of just one randomly selected person.  ,Bernoulli,p = probabilitity that a random person has B- blood (about 2%),variable can only be zero or one,alternate answer is Binomial with n=1
20,2012 Presidential Race,There were 29 national polls published in the week before the 2012 U.S. Presidential race to gauge the voter support for President Barrack Obama and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney.  Before the results of these polls were known: let X = the average percentage of the two-party vote amongst respondents that favor the President’s bid for re-election across the 29 polls.,Normal,mu = percentage of the two-party vote who favored the President's re-election for all voters;  sigma^2 = sum of variances for individual polls/841,each of the 29 individual polls had a large sample size,assumes the average bias across all polls is negligble
